bomb diffusal
- pile of crap, remove it (beneath the surface) http://haxeflixel.com/demos/MouseEventManager/
- Show a Bomb timer and some taps
- Unscrew the taps http://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-use-bsp-trees-to-generate-game-maps--gamedev-12268
- Add more taps if needed
- Find the symbol between the taps like a puzzle
- Book with the trademark and the symbol of the bomb maker. Also the voltage.
- Check different cable ends to check the voltage and diffuse it if voltages match :D

trash behavior:
- Trash will be papers, gum envelopes, panflets, etc.
- Trash can be removed from the screen
- trash will spawn at different rates: papers flying because wind, etc

covers:
- Screwed with a random number of screws (1, 3, 5)
- Can be removed, rotated and flipped
- behind them there will be parts of the manifacturer's logo so they can be assembled and find the correct diffusal path

screws:
- Will hold the covers and the cables
- Will have different types of screw ( star, line, tripoint )

Timer:
- Will start the countdown at the start
- End of game if reach 0

Cables:
- Following the diffusal instructions will be cut or removed
- A screw will connect each extreme of the cable
- Will give the correct voltage if tested each extreme


WIN:
- The bomb is diffused by stopping the timer

LOSE:
- The bomb will explode if:
  - The time runs out.
  - The user make a wrong movement (maybe remove some of the total time)
